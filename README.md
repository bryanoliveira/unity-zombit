# Die Zombit

In a world overrun by zombies you must survive as long as possible and defeat different bosses while unlocking weapons, upgrades, equipments, characters, maps and much more. Reviving the classics of the 80's and 90's, Die Zombit is a retrowave top-down shooting game that has a striking soundtrack and an addictive gameplay which guarantee many hours of fun.

I made this game during my first year of Computer Science graduation - I had a lot of free time back then. I believe it could be much improved with newer versions of Unity3D, better design patterns and algorithmic complexity in mind. Yet, it is a fun game that you can [download](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.elitgames.zombit) (an older version) in Play Store.
